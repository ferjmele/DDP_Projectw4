## This application is part of the DDP Project from JHU

Buenos Aires is the biggest Province (State) in Argentina, both by population and area. It is divided in 135 counties.  
  
The application allows you to plot Population vs Area of the counties which are above the Population threshold chosen using the Sliderbar on the upper left corner.  
  
Moving the Slidebar Panel automatically adjusts the plot, showing only counties above the selected population. Besides, application will show Average Population and Area of those selected counties below the plot.  

It also allows to add average population and area lines to the plot, always accounting for the counties above the selected population threshold. This can be done using checkboxes below Sliderbar Panel.
